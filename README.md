# space-journey

My first React-Redux web app, designed using Material Design and Material-UI. The application allows you to view the astronomical photo of the day with a brief explanation and access to archive photos. You also have the option of following Near-Earth Objects, track their closest approach date, and gain information on their miss distance, sizes, velocity and orbiting body.

I used free NASA api, available at: https://api.nasa.gov
